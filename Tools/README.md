# TOOLS
In this folder you find a set of quick and dirty tools to feed information or seek information needed for some of the blog post's projects.

* **FindMyRPI.sh**
It's a shell script that helps you find a RPi on the network when you have just turned it on and have no clue of what was its IP address and have no screen connected to it.

* **spoofOutput.sh**
It's a basic script to grab the output of a previous command and grep that output for executing whatever you want after that.
