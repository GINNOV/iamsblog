        <h2>The Magic of the Amiga Copper</h2>
        <p>Hey Amiga fans! Ever looked at a stunning Amiga demo or game and wondered how they pulled off those amazing color effects? You know the ones â€“ the vibrant, multi-colored skies that seem to defy the Amiga's color limits, or a screen that's split into different color palettes? The secret, my friends, often lies in one of the Amiga's most unique and powerful hardware features: the <strong>Copper</strong>.</p>

        <h3>What in the World is a Copper?</h3>
        <p>In the heart of the Amiga's custom chipset lies a special co-processor called the Copper. Think of it as a tiny, dedicated graphics programmer that works alongside the main CPU. While the CPU is busy running the game's logic or your Workbench applications, the Copper is tirelessly manipulating the display hardware.</p>
        <p>The Copper's job is simple but powerful: it can change the contents of the Amiga's hardware registers at very specific moments in time. This is key. It's all about timing. The Amiga generates its display by drawing the screen line by line, from top to bottom. The Copper can be programmed to "watch" for a specific screen line and, at the precise moment the video beam reaches that line, it can zap a new value into a hardware register.</p>

        <h3>The Magic of Copper Lists</h3>
        <p>So, how do you tell the Copper what to do? You create a <strong>Copper list</strong>, which is just a simple program for the Copper to follow. This list is a series of instructions that the Copper executes in sync with the screen drawing.</p>
        <p>A Copper list is made up of just three basic instructions:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
            <li><strong>WAIT:</strong> This tells the Copper to pause until the video beam reaches a specific horizontal and vertical position on the screen.</li>
            <li><strong>MOVE:</strong> This instruction writes a value to a specified hardware register.</li>
            <li><strong>SKIP:</strong> This tells the Copper to skip the next instruction if the video beam has already passed a certain position.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By combining these simple instructions, you can create some truly <a href="copper.html">amazing</a> effects.</p>

        <h2>Your First Copper List: A Hands-On Tutorial</h2>
        <p>Reading about it is one thing, but making it happen is where the real fun is! This tutorial will get our hands dirty with some 68k assembly to talk directly to the hardware.</p>
        
        <h3>The Real Deal: A Two-Color Screen in Assembly</h3>
        <p>This assembly program will create a screen that is white on the top half and blue on the bottom half. It's a fundamental technique that demonstrates the core Copper list concept.</p>
        <h4>The Tools:</h4>
        <p>You'll need an assembler. A great option for cross-compiling from your Mac is <strong>vasm</strong>. You can install it easily using Homebrew (`brew install vasm`).</p>
        <h4>The Code (split_screen.asm):</h4>

        <h4>How to Assemble and Test It on Your Mac:</h4>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
            <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Open Terminal, navigate to where you saved the `.asm` file, and run the vasm command: `vasmm68k_mot -Fhunk -o split_screen split_screen.asm`</li>
            <li><strong>Set up Emulator:</strong> We'll use FS-UAE. Create a folder on your Mac (e.g., `~/Amiga/Work`). In the FS-UAE settings, go to the "Hard Drives" tab and add this folder as a hard drive. Give it a device name like `DH0` and a volume label like `Work`.</li>
            <li><strong>Run in Emulator:</strong>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
                    <li>Start FS-UAE with a basic Amiga 500 config and your `Work` folder mounted. You'll likely need a Workbench disk in `DF0:` to boot from.</li>
                    <li>Once Workbench loads, you'll see your `Work` drive on the desktop. Open it, and you should see your `split_screen` executable.</li>
                    <li>Open the Shell or CLI from the System drawer on your Workbench disk.</li>
                    <li>Type `Work:split_screen` and press Enter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>See the result:</strong> Your emulator screen should now show the top half white and the bottom half blue! To exit, you'll need to reset the emulator (using the menu in FS-UAE or vAmiga).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>AMOS to the Rescue</h3>
        <p>If diving into 68k assembly seems a bit daunting, don't worry! The legendary AMOS Professional made playing with the Copper incredibly accessible. You can create a classic rainbow effect with just a few lines of code.</p>
        <h4>The Code:</h4>
        
        <div class="code-block-wrapper">
            <button class="copy-code-button"><i class="far fa-copy"></i> Copy</button>
            <pre><code><span class="code-comment">' -- Our First AMOS Copper Rainbow --</span>

    B = ((Y/32) <span class="code-keyword">And</span> 15)
    Colour = (R * <span class="code-hex">$111</span>) + (G * <span class="code-hex">$11</span>) + B
    
    <span class="code-comment">' Move the new colour into the background colour register ($DFF180)</span>

<span class="code-comment">' An empty loop to keep our program running</span>
<span class="code-keyword">Do</span>
<span class="code-keyword">Loop</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h4>How to Test It:</h4>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
            <li><strong>Get AMOS:</strong> You can find AMOS Professional ADF (floppy disk image) files online.</li>
            <li><strong>Use an Emulator:</strong> The easiest way to run this is with a Mac-based Amiga emulator like FS-UAE or vAmiga. Set up a basic Amiga 500 configuration with at least 1MB of Chip RAM.</li>
            <li><strong>Load and Run:</strong> Insert the AMOS disk ADF into the virtual floppy drive (DF0:). Boot the emulator. Once you're in the AMOS editor, type in the code above and press F10 (or your Mac's equivalent) or click "Run" from the menu. You should see a beautiful, flowing rainbow of colours filling the screen!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Where to See the Copper in Action</h3>
        <p>To truly appreciate the power of the Copper, you need to see it in action. Fire up your emulator and check out some of these classics:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
            <li><strong>Shadow of the Beast:</strong> The quintessential example of Copper rainbows.</li>
            <li><strong>Turrican II:</strong> Features vast, colorful levels with smooth scrolling, all orchestrated by the Copper.</li>
            <li><strong>Agony:</strong> The stunning, ethereal backgrounds are a masterclass in Copper programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Demos from the demoscene:</strong> Groups like Phenomena, Sanity, and Spaceballs pushed the Copper to its absolute limits, creating visual effects that still impress today.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">The Copper is a testament to the forward-thinking design of the Amiga. It's a feature that gave developers a huge amount of creative freedom and is a big reason why Amiga graphics have such a unique and timeless appeal. So next time you see a beautiful gradient sky or a clever screen effect on your Amiga, you'll know that the little co-processor that could, the Copper, is hard at work.</p>
