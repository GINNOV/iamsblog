        <h2>A little story</h2>
        <p>
          The Commodore Amiga is a legendary platform that revolutionized
          computing with its advanced graphics, sound, and multitasking. This
          site is dedicated to “almost” developers who share a passion for
          coding on the Amiga, whether in 68k assembly, C, or modern AmigaOS with
          macOS in mind.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          By “almost” I mean you know your way around coding tools, but you can't
          split the byte just yet like a digital lumberjack.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          My fascination with the Amiga began in the 1980s, drawn to its
          groundbreaking hardware and vibrant developer community. From coding
          demos in AMOS to exploring AmigaOS, the Amiga shaped my love for
          programming. 
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
          Back then I only spoke my native language and there was
          no Internet. Even BBS were out of my reach. 40 years later and a
          successful career that would have not been possible if it wasn’t for
          the Amiga in my life, I have a hitch on "what I could have learned if I
          didn’t have the knowledge gap?"
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
          So... let’s find out together. I will share
          what I learn and if you know better share away.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          There are many resources out there, consider this my open learning
          diary back to when I was 15 with some additional powers 😅. <br>Aloha 🌴.
