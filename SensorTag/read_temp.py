# Read temperature from the TMP006 sensor in the TI SensorTag 
# It's a BLE (Bluetooth low energy) device so using gatttool to
# read and write values. 
#
# Usage.
# sensortag_test.py BLUETOOTH_ADR
#
# To find the address of your SensorTag run 'sudo hcitool lescan'
# You'll need to press the side button to enable discovery.
#
# Notes.
# pexpect uses regular expression so characters that have special meaning
# in regular expressions, e.g. [ and ] must be escaped with a backslash.
