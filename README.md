# One man's junk is another manâ€™s treasure

I have skills, passions, and hobbies across multiple spaces.

I make stuff for myself, and if, in the process, I realize that someone else could use an adrenaline shot at the end of a long Google search, I share it as is, no frills.

I hope, today, that it's you.
