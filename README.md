# One man's junk is another man’s treasure

🧘🏼 In this repo there is a little bit of everything across multiple domains or science and technology. Like in a garage sale, you never know until you cruise through and take a chance on something.

🏴‍☠️ I’m a jack-of-all-trades, passionate about various things.

I create stuff for myself, and if I come across something that might be useful for someone else after a long Google search, I share it without any fancy packaging.


🙏🏼 I hope, today, that it's you.
