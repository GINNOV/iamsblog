# Amiga Tools for macOS

The whole spiel on what the tools do and why I am doing this is all nicely
documented [here](https://ginnov.github.io/littlethings/).

Each folder has the project and the source code, if you are looking just for the compiled (Apple Silicon only 99.9% of the times) look at the folder [releases](https://github.com/GINNOV/littlethings/tree/master/Amiga/Tools/releases).

If you have questions, you know what to do.

Enjoy.
