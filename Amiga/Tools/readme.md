# Amiga Tools for macOS

The whole spiel on what the tools do and why I am doing this is all nicely
documented [here](https://ginnov.github.io/littlethings/).

Each project folder has the source code and if there's some, additional documentation too. If you are looking just for the compiled app (Apple Silicon only 99.9% of the times) take a look at the folder [releases](https://github.com/GINNOV/littlethings/tree/master/Amiga/Tools/releases).

Some of those tools have an amiga counterpart. I test them in FS-UAE and vAmiga, occasionally I bust out my Amiga 1200 but not as often as I probably should. ðŸ˜…

If you have questions, you know what to do.

Enjoy.
