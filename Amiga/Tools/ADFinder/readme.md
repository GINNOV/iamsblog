# ADFinder

I found myself wanting to work on an ADF image in the same way modern computers allow to manage files. 

macOS spoils users with the easy going user interface and I didn't find any tool out there that would offer the rich experience and being compatible with the need of an amiga engineer.

So I start building it. More details [here](https://ginnov.github.io/littlethings/)
