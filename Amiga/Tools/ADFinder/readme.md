# ADFinder

I found myself wanting to work on an ADF image in the same way modern computers allow to manage files. 

macOS spoils users with the easy going user interface and I didn't find any tool out there that would offer the rich experience and being compatible with the need of an amiga engineer.

So I start building it. Details and pre-built app are [here](https://ginnov.github.io/littlethings/)

## Features List

1.	✅ Load ADFs that workbench can read
2.	✅ Show the content of files in a HEX editor
3.	✅ Navigate folder structure back and forth
4.	✅ Delete files and folder
5.	✅ Create an ADF from scratch
6.	✅ Open ADF images by dropping the image over the files’ window
7.	✅ Show disk layout, file usage and other stats
8.	✅ Create new folders
9.	✅ Rename files and folders
10.	✅ Sorting (different kinds)
11.	✅ Preferences
12.	✅ Create blank image
13. ✅ Add files to image

## Work in Progress
19.	👷🏻 Add files via Drag and Drop
20.	👷🏻 Compare two ADF images (raw or files matching?)
21.	👷🏻 Auto convert audio when adding them to an image
22.	👷🏻 Auto convert image format when adding them to an image
23.	👷🏻 Text view (to copy files)
24.	👷🏻 Download files

# What it looks like?
If you are just curios about the app, here are some screenshots.
The main UI allows you to navigate folders and do some file operations on it.
