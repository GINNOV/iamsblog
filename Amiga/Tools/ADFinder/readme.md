# ADFinder

I found myself wanting to work on an ADF image in the same way modern computers allow to manage files. 

macOS spoils users with the easy going user interface and I didn't find any tool out there that would offer the rich experience and being compatible with the need of an amiga engineer.

So I start building it. Details and pre-built app are [here](https://ginnov.github.io/littlethings/)

## Features List

1.	✅ Load ADFs that workbench can read
2.	✅ Show the content of files in a HEX editor
3.	✅ Navigate folder structure back and forth
4.	✅ Delete files and folder
5.	✅ Create an ADF from scratch
6.	✅ Open ADF images by dropping the image over the files’ window
7.	✅ Show disk layout, file usage and other stats
8.	✅ Create new folders
9.	✅ Rename files and folders
10.	✅ Sorting (different kinds)
11.	✅ Preferences
12.	✅ Create blank image for FSO/FFS
13. ✅ Add files to image
14. ✅ Set file permissions and attributes
15. ✅ Retrieve permissions and attributes
16. ✅ Text Editor built in

## Work in Progress / Thinking about
19.	👷🏻 Add files via Drag and Drop
20.	👷🏻 Compare two ADF images (raw or files matching?)
21.	👷🏻 Auto convert audio when adding them to an image
22.	👷🏻 Auto convert image format when adding them to an image
23.	👷🏻 Download files
