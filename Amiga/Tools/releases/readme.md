# Release notes

* Only the last three builds are kept on the repo.
* If you pick the biggest build number you always have the latest (doh...).
* Some functionalities like Shortcuts integration are only possible with a signed build. That means if you have an Apple Developer paid account you can generate yourself or you don't get that functionality. I will eventually push a build on the App Store to make it simpler for people.
