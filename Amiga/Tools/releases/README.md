# Quarantine Flag
Since the app is not signed (Apple needs more money for that...), you need to remove the default quarantine flag. To do that you have three free options. Pick one.

**Terminal**:
just run this command `xattr -rc ~/Downloads/ADFinder.app`

**GUI**: Sentil is a great app for managing the quarantine and signing. Free to use. It's [here](https://github.com/alienator88/Sentinel).

**Prerefences**: If you know what this means I don't have to explain it :-) 

Enjoy.
