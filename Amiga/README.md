# Amiga
If it werenâ€™t for the Commodore Amiga, I would have never started the career that shaped my future and self-growth. Back then, I could only speak my native language, and there was no Internet. Even BBS were out of my reach.

Decades later, I wanted to get my knowledge thirst quenched and live what it could have been and some more.

This folder in the repo is for all folks out there that have that flashback-needy energy that needs a plug.

I don't know what I am doing, but what I share here worked for me, and I hope it does some good for you too.

# Website
If you fancy something cooler than a markdown I have a few web pages that gives you the gist and links for all things Amiga in this repo. It's [here](https://ginnov.github.io/littlethings/).
