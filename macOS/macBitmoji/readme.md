#macBitmoji
a very basic addon for macOS that allows you to retrieve your customized avatars from any app even if you don't have your browser running.

##Why I built this?
A few reasons starting with a good excuse to write my first macOS app. With ObjC I always felt that it was a lot of work to put any basic app together. With Swift and lots of paradigms much closer to iOS I figured that this was the right time.

The second and very important reason is that I got so used to express myself with bitmoji that when I answer to messages from my mac I want to keep my consistency with the emotions attached to the messages. Bitmoji doesn't make an app for the mac so I solve the problem.

##Critize, please.
It is my first app ever for macOS so if I did something incredibly stupid please do let me know what should have I done differently. I don't take it personally, quite the opposite I value somebody else knoweldge shared with good will. For anything that is just novice silliness you can pass it over, I will learn as I go. But hey, it's the Internet do what you want :-)

#License
Do what you want with it edition. If you improved it, please go ahead a make a PR I would be happy to use it.
